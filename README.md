# Lingle â€” Wordle but longer
Lingle is an adaptation to a popular NYT game called Wordle. Click [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to check out the original Wordle Game.

The rules to Worldle are simple. Just guess a word. Any word with five letters. Hints will appear after each word guess, showing whether letters are in the right spot, in the word but in the wrong spot, or not in the word at all. Using these hints, make another guess and repeat until youâ€™ve got the wordâ€”or donâ€™t get the word, and lose.

If the color of the hint is green, the letter is in the word and in the correct spot.

If the color of the hint is yellow, the letter is in the word but is in the wrong spot.

If the color of the hint is grey, the letter is not in the word and should be discarded.

We extended gameplay functionalities in Lingle from Wordle. In wordle, users get 6 tries to guess the word; we allowed unlimited tries for users to guess the word. We allowed users to choose what letter words they want to play with, rather than the default five ltter words from Wordle. We also implemented a Play Again function, where Wordle only lets you play their game once a day.
